//! @brief Text rendering library to draw LECO font
//!
//! Library to draw LECO font at any size as well as to calculate the
//! size of any string at a certain font size. Also allows to draw
//! some string at the largest size that will fit inside a certain rectangle.
//! All text in this library have half-size kerning on both sides of letters.
